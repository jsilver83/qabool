== Introduction

=== Purpose

Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended
audience. (e.g. “This software design document describes the
architecture and system design of XX. ....”).

=== Scope

Provide a description and scope of the software and explain the goals,
objectives and benefits of your project. This will provide the basis
for the brief description of your product.

=== Overview

Provide an overview of this document and its organization.

=== Reference Material

_This section is optional._

List any documents, if any, which were used as sources of information
for the test plan.

=== Definitions and Acronyms

_This section is optional._

Provide definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations that
might exist to properly interpret the SDD. These definitions should be
items used in the SDD that are most likely not known to the audience.


== System Overview

Give a general description of the functionality, context and design of
your project. Provide any background information if necessary.


== System Architecture

=== Architectural Design

Develop a modular program structure and explain the relationships
between the modules to achieve the complete functionality of the
system. This is a high level overview of how responsibilities of the
system were partitioned and then assigned to subsystems. Identify each
high level subsystem and the roles or responsibilities assigned to
it. Describe how these subsystems collaborate with each other in order
to achieve the desired functionality. Don’t go into too much detail
about the individual subsystems. The main purpose is to gain a general
understanding of how and why the system was decomposed, and how the
individual parts work together. Provide a diagram showing the major
subsystems and data repositories and their interconnections. Describe
the diagram if required.

=== Decomposition Description

Provide a decomposition of the subsystems in the architectural
design. Supplement with text as needed. You may choose to give a
functional description or an object­oriented description. For a
functional description, put top­level data flow diagram (DFD) and
structural decomposition diagrams. For an OO description, put
subsystem model, object diagrams, generalization hierarchy diagram(s)
(if any), aggregation hierarchy diagram(s) (if any), interface
specifications, and sequence diagrams here.

=== Design Rationale

Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in 3.1
including critical issues and trade/offs that were considered. You may
discuss other architectures that were considered, provided that you
explain why you didn’t choose them.


== Data Design

===  Data Description

Explain how the information domain of your system is transformed into
data structures. Describe how the major data or system entities are
stored, processed and organized. List any databases or data storage
items.

===  Data Dictionary

Alphabetically list the system entities or major data along with their
types and descriptions. If you provided a functional description in
Section 3.2, list all the functions and function parameters. If you
provided an OO description, list the objects and its attributes,
methods and method parameters.


== Component Design

In this section, we take a closer look at what each component does in
a more systematic way. If you gave a functional description in section
3.2, provide a summary of your algorithm for each function listed in
3.2 in procedural description language (PDL) or pseudocode. If you
gave an OO description, summarize each object member function for all
the objects listed in 3.2 in PDL or pseudocode. Describe any local
data when necessary.


== Human Interface Design

=== Overview of User Interface

Describe the functionality of the system from the user’s
perspective. Explain how the user will be able to use your system to
complete all the expected features and the feedback information that
will be displayed for the user.

=== Screen Images

Display screenshots showing the interface from the user’s
perspective. These can be hand­drawn or you can use an automated
drawing tool. Just make them as accurate as possible. (Graph paper
works well.)

=== Screen Objects and Actions

A discussion of screen objects and actions associated with those
objects.


== Requirements Matrix

Provide a cross­reference that traces components and data structures
to the requirements in your SRS document.

Use a tabular format to show which system components satisfy each of
the functional requirements from the SRS. Refer to the functional
requirements by the numbers/codes that you gave them in the SRS.

[appendix]
== First Appendix

_This section is optional._

Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to
provide supporting details that could aid in the understanding of the
Software Design Document.
