Application administrator must have the basic understanding how to use the system to
manage and filter student list using BI, manipulate students' uploaded documents and data entered.

Student affairs::
They must have the basic understanding how to use (BI) in order to view different type of reports.

Registrar::
They must have the basic understanding how to use (BI) in order to view different type of reports.

=== Hardware Interfaces

None

=== Software Interfaces

NOTE: TBD

=== Communications Interfaces

- The system must support email and SMS notifications for different activities.
These notifications include:
** Notifying students when the registration has been submitted successfully to admission.
** Notifying students when they confirm and accept study at KFUPM.
** Notifying both application administrator and
students when the withdrawal has been submitted to admission.

== Functional Requirements
NOTE: TODO: Joud

<This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for
the product by system features (functional requirement by functional
requirement), the major services provided by the product. You may
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user
class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these,
whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.>

=== Functional Requirement 1

<Don’t really say “Functional Requirement 1.” State the feature name
in just a few words. List each functionality of the system in full
detail using full use case descriptions. See Use Case Description
document. The organization of this chapter should facilitate the
correct design of the system and support validation testing. Each use
case must include validity checks on inputs, the sequence of
operations, and responses to abnormal situations.

State Transition Diagrams may be used effectively to describe
complicated sequences of operations. It is essential that this section
be as clear as possible.

Each item here is explicitly cross-referenced back to section
3.1. Each item here must be uniquely identified to allow backward
references from the design and testing documents. When those documents
are finished, forward references to their specific sections are added
here. >

ID: FR1

==== Description and Priority
NOTE: TODO: Joud and Bassam

<Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is
of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific
priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk
(each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).>

==== Stimulus/Response Sequences
NOTE: TODO: Joud and Bassam

<List the sequences of user actions and system responses that
stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond
to the dialog elements associated with use cases.>

<Full use case descriptions can be used here>

==== Functional Requirements

<Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this
feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in
order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature,
or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to
anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be
concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD”
as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet
available.>

<Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number
or a meaningful tag of some kind.>

REQ-1 :: <details>
REQ-2 :: <details>

=== Functional Requirement 2 (and so on)


== Other Nonfunctional Requirements

[[PerReq]]

=== Performance Requirements

* The web application should be hosted on a cloud service that should guarantee
99.9% uptime. In addition, The response time must be less than 5 seconds for all
 users' interactions
* The web application must support 1,000+ concurrent requesters which will on
a busy day generate 10,000+ interaction.

=== Safety Requirements

None.

=== Security Requirements

Since this system handles sensitive and mission-critical data, it should provide
tight data security that shall prevent direct and unauthorized access. Penetration testing
should be conducted (by third-party if possible) to assure that.

=== Software Quality Attributes

==== Portability

The web application should work on all major hand-held devices including
smart-phones and tablets. This should be achieved by using responsive user interface
that shall scale gracefully according to display screen size.

==== Reliability & Availability

Since this system is mission-critical to KFUPM, it should be hosted on reliable
hosting service that can fulfill <<PerReq,Performance Requirements>> stated above.
Moreover, system data must be backed up every day twice and the backup copies should be
stored at different physical location for disaster recovery.

==== Scalability

This system will be hosted on a cloud service to provide better performance. Hence,
the system should be designed and implemented to be cloud-ready. Stress testing should
be conducted (by third part if possible) to assure this.

==== Usability

Since this web application will be used by a large number of end-users from various
backgrounds, it should be user-friendly. The screen layouts should be trivial.
Field names should be clear and unambiguous and hints/tips should be
provided inline to explain complicated tasks required from users whenever necessary.

== Other Requirements

The web application should have bilingual user interface that can be used to
switch the display language at any time by the end-user. The layout should change
according to the display language between RTL and LTR.
